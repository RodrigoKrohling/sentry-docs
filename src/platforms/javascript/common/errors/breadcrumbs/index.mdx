title: Breadcrumbs
---

Sentry supports a concept called Breadcrumbs, which is a trail of events that happened prior to an issue. Oftentimes these events are very similar to traditional logs, but also have the ability to record more rich structured data.

### Modify Breadcrumbs

Developers who want to modify the breadcrumbs interface can read about this in detail using the developer documentation devoted to the [Breadcrumbs Interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/). Manual breadcrumb recording and customization of breadcrumbs are documented on this page.

### Manual Breadcrumbs

You can manually add breadcrumbs whenever something interesting happens. For example, you might manually record a breadcrumb if the user authenticates or another state change happens.

This example is for an application that sometimes throws an error after the screen resizes.

```javascript
// `debounce` function comes from a 3rd party library like Lodash or can be implemented manually
window.addEventListener(
  "resize",
  debounce(function(event) {
    Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
      category: "ui",
      message:
        "New window size:" + window.innerWidth + "x" + window.innerHeight,
      level: "info",
    });
  })
);
```

### Customize Breadcrumbs

SDKs customize breadcrumbs through the `before_breadcrumb` hook. This hook passes an already assembled breadcrumb assembled breadcrumb and, in some SDKs, an optional hint. The function can modify the breadcrumb or decide to discard it entirely.
